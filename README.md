# Automatic Blinds Exercise 💻
### Project for Embedded Platforms and Communications for IoT
The main purpose of this project is to  design and implement a simple automatic blinds system.

### 💠 Specifications

- Two working modes: summer (if light level is high blinds are down) and winter (the opposite).  
- Ambience light should be measured each 1 sec. ~ 10 sec. using the light sensor (it is not necessary to make this parameter configurable).  
- User button will be used to change between working modes. 
- Consider a levelling up and down time of ~30 sec.  Consider the use of a threshold for the ambience light measure.
- The states of the system are the following:  Blinds states: raised, down, rising, lowering.  Working mode: summer and winter.
- The system states should be informed by using LEDs or serial (received in the PC) and updated each 2 sec.
- Minimal operation: to be able to measure the ambience light and change between blinds states 
- Use of threads 
- The use of the serial instead - or jointly - of LEDs will be considered as an extra.
